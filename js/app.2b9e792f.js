This means that clearing your browser's cache or cookies, or fully\nuninstalling the game from Steam will also delete your save file.\nSimilarly, if you are playing in a private or incognito window, your save\nwill not be there the next time you open up your browser. The saves are browser-specific as well, so for example\nif you play the game on Chrome, you will not find your save on Firefox. Lastly, any saves you have on the web version\nand the Steam version will also be completely independent from each other.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can transfer your save between places by using the export function, which will copy a <i>very</i> long string of\nrandom-looking characters into your clipboard. That text contains your save data, which you can load back into the\ngame by pasting it into the text box on the import prompt. You need the entirety of the save text for importing to\nwork properly, or else the game might not recognize the text as a valid save. Certain messaging applications may\ncut off part of the text if you are using one to transfer the save between devices.\n<br>\n<br>\nA properly-formatted save string from the Reality update will start with\n<b>${GameSaveSerializer.startingString.savefile}</b> and end with <b>${GameSaveSerializer.endingString.savefile}</b>.\nIf you are importing from a version of the game from before Reality was released, it will instead start with <b>eyJ</b>\nand end with <b>In19</b>, <b>fX0=</b>, or <b>fQ==</b>. If neither of these are the case, then part of your save is\nmissing and it will fail to import. In addition to importing and exporting to your clipboard, you can also import\nand export from text files as well.\n<br>\nYou can use the "Choose save" button to pick between three separate saves on your browser. These saves are, for most\nintents and purposes, completely separate from each other. Importing and exporting will only affect the current save\nslot. <b>The only exception is clearing your browser or Steam data, in which case all three saves will be reset.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe game automatically saves periodically, by default once every ${formatInt(30)} seconds.\nKeep this in mind if you need to close the game - anything you\ndo right before closing it might not be saved unless you wait for the autosave interval or manually save again. The\nlength of the autosave interval is adjustable, and its timer can be seen in the bottom-left of the screen.\n<br>\n<br>\nBackups of your savefile are also saved after certain amounts of time online or offline, which you can examine and\nreload at any point by clicking the "Open Automatic Save Backup Menu" button. These backups may be useful if you wish\nto revert your save to what it looked like some time in the past, such as a few minutes ago or when you were last\noffline for a while.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can also connect a Google Account to the game, allowing you to save your progress online.

The simulation behavior is only somewhat accurate, as the game is too mathematically\ncomplicated to be run at full accuracy in a reasonable amount of time. At the end of the simulation, the game will\nsummarize how various relevant resources have changed while you were gone.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the game is left open and becomes unfocused or otherwise suspended for an extended period of time, it will attempt\nto apply the missed time as offline progress when you return. This can be potentially unreliable, as different devices\nhandle these situations differently. If this results in undesirable behavior, there is a toggle to turn this off in the\noptions - in that case the game will try to apply all the missed time in a single tick.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe game runs on a system where everything is updated once per tick - all Dimensions and resources do one unit of\nproduction, all autobuyers trigger once, all multipliers and values are changed accordingly, and all the displayed\nnumbers are updated. By default there are ${formatInt(20)} ticks per second when the game is running, although this can\nbe modified by changing the "Update rate" within the game Options.\nYour current settings will run the game at ${format(1e3/player.options.updateRate,2,1)} ticks per second on\naverage, although lag and internal javascript behavior may cause individual ticks to vary by a few percent.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen offline simulation is active, these ticks have an adjusted length in order to fill the amount of time you were\naway - for example having a setting for ${formatInt(1e3)} offline ticks and closing the game for an hour will result in\nticks which are ${format(3.6,1,1)} seconds long each. For most things in the game, this is not an issue because this\nwill still result in approximately the same amount of resources after the simulation completes. A notable exception is\nautobuyers - in this situation autobuyers will effectively only trigger once every ${format(3.6,1,1)} seconds, which\nmay have a strong impact depending on the part of the game.\n<br>\n<br>\n${player.blackHole[0].unlocked?'<b>Offline Black Hole behavior:</b> Once the Black Hole has been unlocked, the offline progress simulation will\n      attempt to run the game in a way where each tick contains roughly the same amount of <i>game</i> time. This may\n      give the appearance of the Black Hole(s) being active for a much larger fraction of time than normal while\n      simulating, when in fact the game is running active periods more slowly and "skipping past" the inactive periods\n      because they contribute much less production per real time.

For every real-time second that\npasses, you gain stored real time (modified by some efficiency factor). You can use stored real time in order to\namplify a Reality in the Glyphs tab. When you complete the Reality, this uses all of your stored real time at once\nin order to attempt to repeat that\nexact Reality over and over, giving you all the rewards you would normally get from the repetitions.

You're f*cking dead,\n      kiddo."},{id:"a113",text:"So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's a\n      game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension\n      provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too\n      plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the\n      fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just\n      thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that\n      add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You\n      start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep\n      going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to\n      infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very\n      large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming\n      infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your\n      happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you\n      go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your\n      life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know\n      what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give\n      you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car\n      being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities'\n      are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with\n      seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional\n      Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is\n      new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had.\n      'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy.\n      Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness.",get unlocked(){return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked()}},{id:"a114",text:"(Make me sleep) Put me to sleep inside.

More\n      alarmingly, some media outlets publish these same true stories, stories that aren't just propaganda,\n      without checking government talking points first. Unfortunately, some members of the media use their\n      platforms to push a logically sound opinion and unbiased agenda to diversify 'exactly what antimatter\n      thinks'. This is extremely dangerous to our dictatorship. At ANN it's our responsibility to pursue\n      and report the lies. We understand lies are neither 'left or right' politically. Our commitment to\n      fearmongering slander is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever. But we are incorporeal\n      8D beings of antimatter, and sometimes our propaganda techniques might fall short.

We won't respond back to you because you would've\n      deleted your comment with the hard reset button before you get it.

An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is\n      held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that's useful because that's the only part that\n      matters; however, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and\n      tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that's useful or\n      important, so don't worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would\n      look like this: /¯\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to\n      finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that\n      total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this Eternity in isolation then yes, it would be\n      three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run,\n      such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well,\n      then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the\n      three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in\n      three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only\n      required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M\n      presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this\n      phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you'd round up that up to three, but in\n      a full game run, you'd round it down to two. So, in conclusion, since that first M press counts in some\n      contexts, but adds no additional presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a \"Half M Press\"."},{id:"a260",text:"It seems that the Replicanti have a very divide-and-conquer method of doing things.\n      Well, everything at this rate.",get unlocked(){return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked()||PlayerProgress.replicantiUnlocked()}},{id:"a261",text:"Antimatter Dimensions is actually a Roguelite game!
